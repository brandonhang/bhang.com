                    <p>
                        Whether it's performing in pit orchestras for school musicals, jamming with others
                        at open mic nights, or playing the piano without an audience, music has always
                        been a major part of my life. It all started in the 4th grade when my grade school
                        music teacher said I should give the trombone a shot, most likely due to the
                        drought of trombonists at my school at the time. Well, it turned out that I had a
                        knack for the
                        <a href="#" ng-click="showPicture($event, 'tbone.jpg')">brass monster</a>.
                    </p>
                    <div id="j-j-johnson" class="music-notes"></div>
                    <p>
                        I didn't stop at the trombone though. I picked up the
                        <a href="#" ng-click="showPicture($event, 'sax.jpg')">alto saxophone in 6th grade</a>
                        and started piano in the 7th. And while I never did much with the saxophone, I
                        flourished when seated behind the black and white keys. My big breakthrough on piano
                        came in the 8th grade when I was allowed to play in the pit orchestra for
                        <i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>, despite my inexperience on piano. I
                        practiced for hours on end well past a typical middle-schooler's bedtime, much to
                        the chagrin of my parents' sleep schedules. I ran through the music so many times
                        that I ended up committing the entire score to memory! Later that year, our school's
                        production made a trip up to New York City for a musical festival where I was
                        fortunate enough to perform on a
                        <a href="#" ng-click="showPicture($event, 'steinway-young.jpg')">9-foot Steinway &amp; Sons concert grand piano</a>!
                        I wouldn't play on another such example for
                        <a href="#" ng-click="showPicture($event, 'steinway-old.jpg')">another 12 years</a>.

                        The summer before 10th grade marked a major change for my musical appetite; I was put
                        into a 3-day jazz camp (lol jazz camp) where I worked with professional musicians to
                        learn the ins and outs, or the basics in my case, of jazz improvisation. I had always
                        had an interest in jazz from a young age ever since being introduced to Miles Davis's
                        <i>Kind of Blue</i> and Dave Brubeck's <i>Time Out</i> by my father, but this camp
                        elevated that interest to another level. After that camp, I became enamored with
                        playing jazz&mdash;I ended up forming
                        <a href="#" ng-click="showPicture($event, '4DF.jpg')">my own jazz combo</a>,

                        This musical hobby of mine has done wonderful things for me. From

                        and even singing (badly) at weddings, playing music has given a color to my life that I
