Sporting a twin-tubocharged V6 with 3 electric motors, two up front and one in the rear, Honda's reincarnated super car can sprint to 60 MPH from a dead stop in a mere 3.1 seconds. However, it is quite different from its predecessor. The original NSX was small, lightweight, and rear-wheel drive while the newest rendition is much heavier with all-wheel drive.
