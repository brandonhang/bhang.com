AC was ready to shut down production of their AC Ace as the Bristol straight-six they used wasn&apos;t available anymore. Carroll Shelby in turn stepped in and asked AC to build a car that would fit a V8. It was then, once the AC shell was fitted with a Ford V8, that the Shelby Cobra was born.</p>"

Well, this one was never featured in a James Bond book or film, but it does have the rest of those traits. While a V12 is available for this model, this one is fitted with a V8. It does feel like you would need to be wearing a tuxedo (or a lovely dress) if you were to go anywhere in the Vantage.</p>"
